>Plan Review


How your design or plan has changed since the end of last semester:

  - We came up with a completely new game idea and plan
  
Identify any potential risks and propose solutions:

  - Scope of new game is ambitious; risk of biting off more than can chew
    - Solution is to stay on the ball; have frequent small milestones

List any roadblocks that are preventing the team from making progress and explain how you are going to overcome them:

  - None so far

What are five things that went wrong during this past development period?

1. Coordination of teams could be better; proper use of github not yet adopted

3. 


What are five things that can be improved for future development periods?

1. Learn to use github
2. Improve team coordination by having weekly milestone meetings in class
3. Implement some of the production methodologies from Game Production I
4. Have frequent sprint milestones in order to make sure scope of project is realized by end of development period
5. Make sure every team has a member with more experience to provide guidance
